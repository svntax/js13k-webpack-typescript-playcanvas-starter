## About this fork

This fork adds support for PlayCanvas 2.10.6 for the js13kGames 2025 jam. It uses the npm package for dev, and the CDN hosted by js13k for prod. Run the project to see the [example rotating box scene](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/engine/standalone/) from PlayCanvas's documentation.

Below is the original README.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help make building [JS13k](https://js13kgames.com/) projects easier for folks who are familiar with the JavaScript ecosystem but don't want to go through the hassle of setting up a JS13k-specific build environment. The bulk of this project is a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) config that does the following: 

- Transpiles TypeScript (if any)
- Minifies the resulting JavaScript
- Inlines the JavaScript into an `index.html` file (in production)
- Zips the `index.html` file
- Checks that the zip file is under 13k
- Runs `webpack-bundle-analyzer`

## Requirements

The commands assume [Node and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed.

## Commands

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Starts [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) at `http://0.0.0.0:8081`. You should be able to access the server on your mobile device from your home network by going to your computer's IP address (e.g. `http://192.168.0.2:8081`).

### `npm run build`

Builds, minifies, and inlines the game to `./dist/index.html`. This command also runs [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer), and places the report in `./dist/report.html`. This report may be handy in figuring out which of your source files is putting you over the edge of 13k.

### `npm run party`

Builds, minifies, inlines, and zips the game to `./zipped/game.zip`. This command finishes with a log message letting you know if the zip file is under 13k.

## Notes

- Put your TS or JS in `src/index.ts`
- Put your css in `src/index.html`
- Put your images or other assets in `assets/`
- This starter uses [Roadroller](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/roadroller) to pack the js
